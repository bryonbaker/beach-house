TBC

## ☕ Coffee Machine ☕
Generally the coffee grind should be on 1. You should not need to touch it.

Towards the end of your stay try and run the beans down so there are none or as few as possible left when you leave. This saves the beans from drying out. There is a container in the refrigerator where I keep ground coffee that I have emptied out of the machine when I leave.

The machine is configued for a double shot. Please don't change it unless you know what you are doing.  😵‍💫

### 📖 To use 📖
1. Change the water in the rear reservour.
2. Place some beans in the hopper.
3. Place the coffee portafiller into the grinder holder and press **DOSE**.
